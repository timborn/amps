This is a demo of Docker for MSWindows apps.

In this demo we will build a Docker image of IIS, 
the MSWin web service.

Steps
1. build a docker image from a Dockerfile (recipe)
2. run the container (image)
   N.B. IIS does not behave, by default.  
   Some folks have figured out how to get IIS to 
   handle logfiles better (See 12 Factors).  
   I've applied those changes to this image 
   (see the Dockerfile for details).
   We _expect_ we should be able to use "docker logs' 
   command to see the lofile.
3. check the logile
4. generate a load on our webserver
5. check the logile
6. manually flush the logfile
7. check the logile
