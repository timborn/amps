Installed latest Docker for Mac (CE) on pleasant/10.13/64GB and it never
completes starting.

Version 17.09.0-ce-mac35 (19611)
Channel: stable

Found links to previous versions to try.

To UNinstall, I removed Docker from /Applications and also 
rm -rf ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.*

wget https://download.docker.com/mac/static/stable/x86_64/docker-17.06.2-ce.tgz
