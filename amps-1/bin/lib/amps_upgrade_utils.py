    # AMPS server file to the current version of the AMPS distribution this file is included in (henceforth 'v2')
    #
    # A few different paths are used in the process of reading a production v1 file and producing a production v2 file:
    #
    # live: the path of a v1 file previously created and used by an AMPS v1 server,
    #       the name and relativeness of this path are used in constructing the other paths used by the Entry
    # orig: the path of a backup copy of the live file
    # next: the path of a v2 version of live  intended for use by the  v2 AMPS server
    # temp: the path used if some  temporary file space is needed by the v1 -> v2 upgrade process
    # live_upgraded: the path of the upgraded and published v2 file,
    #                 located in the production directory structure and ready for use by the v2 AMPS server
    # live vs live_upgraded: AMPS v2 may have evolved its naming convention for live since AMPS v1,
    #                        live_upgraded adheres to the v2 naming convention
    #                        e.g.: in 4.0.0 mytopic.sow may have become fix.mytopic.sow
    #
    # most of these paths are constructed relative to a FileStage, provided to the constructor
    #
    # aside from building and providing these named paths,
    # this Entry class doesn't provide any file manipulation operations
    #
    # actual File copy/move/delete operations are provided by the FileStage class
    #
    # upgrade operations are provided by the amps_<filetype>.py lib files and invoked by the amps_upgrade script
    #
    # The rough lifecycle for an Entry is:
    # 1. make a backup copy of live to orig
    # 2. upgrade create a v2 version of orig at next, using temp for temporary space if needed
    # 3. publish next to live_upgraded via a copy/move operation
    #
    # the differentiation between (2) and (3) allows us to complete all upgrade transcoding
    # prior to moving anything into v2 production because of this, the execution of (3) only
    # involves simple operations that should be faster, simpler and less exception-prone than
    # (2), hopefully providing a cleaner transition from
    # the "upgraded" to "deployed to v2 production" states
