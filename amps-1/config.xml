<!-- Sample AMPS configuration

     This file defines an AMPS instance that provides publish and
     subscribe, topic filtering, and content filtering for JSON messages.
     The instance provides messaging services on port 9007 of the server.
     This configuration also provides an adminstrative interface on
     port 8085, and logs serious messages (error and higher severity) to
     stdout. 

     This sample file does not configure State of the World (SOW) Topics,
     Transaction Logs, Queues, Aggregation and Views, Historical Query,
     Replication, Authentication and Entitlement, Conflating Topic Replicas,
     or other features of AMPS.

     More details for the features available and how to configure them are
     provided in the AMPS User Guide and the AMPS Configuration Reference.
     Both are available at http://crankuptheamps.com/documentation/
